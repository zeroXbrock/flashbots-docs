## Interact directly with the Flashbots RPC endpoint

Advanced users can interact with the RPC endpoint at `relay.flashbots.net`, or one of the testnet URLs below.

### Bundle Relay URLS

| Network | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Mainnet | `https://relay.flashbots.net` |
| Goerli | `https://relay-goerli.flashbots.net` |
| Sepolia | `https://relay-sepolia.flashbots.net` |

The API provides JSON-RPC methods for interfacing with Flashbots which are documented below:

### eth_sendBundle

`eth_sendBundle` can be used to send your bundles to the Flashbots builder. The `eth_sendBundle` RPC has the following payload format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendBundle",
  "params": [
    {
      txs,               // Array[String], A list of signed transactions to execute in an atomic bundle
      blockNumber,       // String, a hex encoded block number for which this bundle is valid on
      minTimestamp,      // (Optional) Number, the minimum timestamp for which this bundle is valid, in seconds since the unix epoch
      maxTimestamp,      // (Optional) Number, the maximum timestamp for which this bundle is valid, in seconds since the unix epoch
      revertingTxHashes, // (Optional) Array[String], A list of tx hashes that are allowed to revert
      replacementUuid,   // (Optional) String, UUID that can be used to cancel/replace this bundle
    }
  ]
}
```

example:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendBundle",
  "params": [
    {
      "txs": ["0x123abc...", "0x456def..."],
      "blockNumber": "0xb63dcd",
      "minTimestamp": 0,
      "maxTimestamp": 1615920932
    }
  ]
}
```

example response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "123",
  "result": {
    "bundleHash": "0x2228f5d8954ce31dc1601a8ba264dbd401bf1428388ce88238932815c5d6f23f"
  }
}
```

### eth_cancelBundle

`eth_cancelBundle` is used to prevent a submitted bundle from being included on-chain.
See [bundle cancellations](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/bundle-cancellations) for more information.

> :information_source: `replacementUuid` must have been set when bundle was submitted.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_cancelBundle",
  "params": [
    {
      replacementUuid, // UUIDv4 to uniquely identify submission
    }
  ]
}
```

### eth_sendPrivateTransaction

`eth_sendPrivateTransaction` is used to send a single transaction to Flashbots. Flashbots will attempt to build a block including the transaction for the next 25 blocks. See [Private Transactions](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/private-transaction.mdx) for more info.

[`eth_sendPrivateTransaction`](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-sendprivatetransaction?a=fb) is also supported for free on [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com?a=fb).

This method has the following JSON-RPC format:

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  id: string | number,
  method: "eth_sendPrivateTransaction",
  params: [{
    tx,               // String, raw signed transaction
    maxBlockNumber,   // Hex-encoded number string, optional. Highest block number in which the transaction should be included.
    preferences?: {
      fast: boolean,  // Deprecated; required until this is removed from the API. Value has no effect.
      privacy?: {     // MEV-Share options; optional
        hints?: Array< // data about tx to share w/ searchers on mev-share
            "contract_address" |
            "function_selector" |
            "calldata" |
            "logs" |
            "hash"
        >,
        builders?: Array< // MEV-Share builders to exclusively receive bundles; optional
            "default" |
            "flashbots"
        >,
      },
      validity?: {
        refund?: Array<{address, percent}>
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

example request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendPrivateTransaction",
  "params": [
    {
      "tx": "0x123abc...",
      "maxBlockNumber": "0xcd23a0",
      "preferences": {
        "fast": true, // left for backwards compatibility; may be removed in a future version

          "builders": ["default"]
        },
        "validity": {
          "refund": [{"address": "0xadd123", "percent": 50}]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

example response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x45df1bc3de765927b053ec029fc9d15d6321945b23cac0614eb0b5e61f3a2f2a" // tx hash
}
```

#### `privacy`

By default, transactions are sent to the Flashbots MEV-Share Node with the default [Stable](/flashbots-protect/mev-share#stable-configuration) configuration. The `privacy` parameter allows you to specify your own privacy parameters.

| Param | Type Info | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `hint` | Array of strings | Each hint specifies which data about the transaction will be shared with searchers on mev-share. |
| `builders` | Array of strings | Builders to grant permission to include the transaction in a block. |

**`hint`**

<Hints />

**`builders`**

Flashbots currently supports sending orderflow to the following block builders. This is subject to change over time.

<Builders />

#### `validity`

Validity is used to specify the address and percentage to pay refund from the backrun of this transaction.

By default, the refund is paid to the signer of the transaction and 90% of the backrun value is sent to the user by default.

If multiple refund addresses are specified, then the backrun value is split between them according to the percentage specified.
For example, if refund is `[{address: addr1, percent: 10}, {address: addr1, percent: 20}]` then 10% of the backrun value is sent to `addr1` and 20% is sent to `addr2`
and 70% of the backrun value is left to the builder.

| Param | Type Info | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `refund` | Array of objects | Each entry in the array specifies address that should receive refund from backrun and percent of the backrun value. |
| `refund[].address` | Address | Address that should receive refund. |
| `refund[].percent` | Number | Percentage of the total backrun value that this address should receive. |


### eth_cancelPrivateTransaction

The `eth_cancelPrivateTransaction` method stops private transactions from being submitted for future blocks. A transaction can only be cancelled if the request is signed by the same key as the `eth_sendPrivateTransaction` call submitting the transaction in first place.

[`eth_cancelPrivateTransaction`](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-cancelprivatetransaction?a=fb) is also supported for free on [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com?a=fb).

This method has the following JSON-RPC format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_cancelPrivateTransaction",
  "params": [{
    txHash,   // String, transaction hash of private tx to be cancelled
  }]
}
```

example request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_cancelPrivateTransaction",
  "params": [
    {
      "txHash": "0x45df1bc3de765927b053ec029fc9d15d6321945b23cac0614eb0b5e61f3a2f2a"
    }
  ]
}
```

example response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": true // true if tx successfully cancelled, false if not
}
```

### flashbots_getUserStats

:::caution

flashbots_getUserStats will be deprecated soon, use [flashbots_getUserStatsV2](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint#flashbots_getuserstatsv2)

:::

The `flashbots_getUserStats` JSON-RPC method returns a quick summary of how a searcher is performing in the Flashbots ecosystem, including their [reputation-based priority](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/reputation). It is currently updated once every hour and has the following payload format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "flashbots_getUserStats",
  "params": [
      blockNumber,       // String, a hex encoded recent block number, in order to prevent replay attacks. Must be within 20 blocks of the current chain tip.
  ]
}
```

example response:

```json
{
  "is_high_priority": true,
  "all_time_miner_payments": "1280749594841588639",
  "all_time_gas_simulated": "30049470846",
  "last_7d_miner_payments": "1280749594841588639",
  "last_7d_gas_simulated": "30049470846",
  "last_1d_miner_payments": "142305510537954293",
  "last_1d_gas_simulated": "2731770076"
}
```

where

- `is_high_priority`: boolean representing if this searcher has a high enough reputation to be in the high priority queue
- `all_time_miner_payments`: the total amount paid to validators over all time
- `all_time_gas_simulated`: the total amount of gas simulated across all bundles submitted to Flashbots. This is the actual gas used in simulations, not gas limit

:::note

Parameters with `miner` in the name are retrofitted with Flashbots block builder data to maintain backwards compatibility. This nomenclature will be changed in a future release to accurately reflect PoS Ethereum architecture.

where

- `isHighPriority`: boolean representing if this searcher has a high enough reputation to be in the high priority queue
- `isSimulated`: boolean representing whether the bundle gets simulated. All other fields will be omitted except simulated field if API didn't receive bundle
- `simulatedAt`: time at which the bundle gets simulated
- `receivedAt`: time at which the bundle API received the bundle
- `consideredByBuildersAt`: indicates time at which each builder selected the bundle to be included in the target block
- `sealedByBuildersAt`: indicates time at which each builder sealed a block containing the bundle

### API Response

* All method supports JSON-RPC standards for success response and not supported for error response(V2 methods are exceptions).
* V2 methods supports JSON-RPC standards for both success and error response.

### Authentication

To authenticate your request, Flashbots endpoints require you to sign the payload and include the signed payload in the `X-Flashbots-Signature` header of your request.

```curl
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Flashbots-Signature: 0x1234:0xabcd" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_sendBundle","params":[{see above}],"id":1}' https://relay.flashbots.net
```

Any valid Ethereum key can be used to sign the payload. The Ethereum address associated with this key will be used by Flashbots to keep track of your requests over time and provide user statistics. You can change the key you use at any time.

The signature is calculated by taking the [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) hash of the json body encoded as UTF-8 bytes. Here's an example using ethers.js:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ethers.js"
  values={[
    { label: 'ethers.js', value: 'ethers.js', },
    { label: 'web3.py', value: 'web3.py' },
    { label: 'go', value: 'go' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="ethers.js">

```ts
import { Wallet, utils } from "ethers";

const privateKey = "0x1234";
const wallet = new Wallet(privateKey);
const body =
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_sendBundle","params":[{see above}],"id":1}';
const signature = wallet.address + ":" + wallet.signMessage(utils.id(body));
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="web3.py">

```py
from web3 import Web3
from eth_account import Account, messages

body = '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_sendBundle","params":[{see above}],"id":1}'
message = messages.encode_defunct(text=Web3.keccak(text=body).hex())
signature = Account.from_key(private_key).address + ':' + Account.sign_message(message, private_key).signature.hex()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go">

```go
body := `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_sendBundle","params":[{see above}],"id":1}`
hashedBody := crypto.Keccak256Hash([]byte(body)).Hex()
sig, err := crypto.Sign(accounts.TextHash([]byte(hashedBody)), privKey)
signature := crypto.PubkeyToAddress(privKey.PublicKey).Hex() + ":" + hexutil.Encode(sig)
```
