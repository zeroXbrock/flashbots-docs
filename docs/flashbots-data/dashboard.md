title: Flashbots Transparency Dashboard
---

The Flashbots Transparency Dashboard is a public dashboard of metrics related to the Realised Extractable Value (REV) on Ethereum and Flashbots Relays on MEV-boost - after the merge on September 15 2022. The dashboard shows the Ethereum mainnet data post-merge since block #15537940, and has 1 week freshness delay.

It is part of Flashbots' effort to provide transparency on our products and the broader MEV ecosystem, as well as provide contributors and collaborators the data they need for research. We will continue to update the dashboard with additional metrics as more data becomes available. Explore pre-merge MEV activity here: [MEV-Explore](https://explore.flashbots.net/)

More information can be found in the [announcement post on the forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/will-the-real-mev-please-stand-up/1686).
