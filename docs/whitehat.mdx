If your wallet has been compromised by a malicious third party and you need help recovering remaining funds, we are here to help

Please go to https://whitehat.flashbots.net (and only to this address) to submit a request for help.

Ensure you only interact with [Flashbots Discord](https://discord.gg/flashbots) members with the "whitehat",  "whitehat-associate", or "serv.eth" role.

We can only attempt to rescue remaining funds, we won't be able to get back funds that have already been transfered out from the address.
Please note that the Whitehat team can only assist if remaining assets in the compromised address exceed the minimum rescue amount of $1000.
