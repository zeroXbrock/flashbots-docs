This guide covers the essential steps for wallet & dapp developers to send transactions to MEV-Share.

You can submit your orderflow to the Flashbots **MEV-Share Node** to internalize the MEV generated by your transactions.

### How to Integrate

The Flashbots MEV-Share Node is accessible through the [Flashbots Protect RPC](/flashbots-protect/mev-share#protect-rpc-reference).

#### Send Orderflow to Protect RPC

Route your application's `eth_sendRawTransaction` calls to the Protect RPC [`rpc.flashbots.net`](https://rpc.flashbots.net/) to connect to the MEV-Share Node. By default, connecting to Protect will enable the MEV-Share Node with the Stable configuration, which is set by Flashbots to give users the best possible execution.

#### Set Privacy Configuration

To specify a custom privacy configuration, options are passed as URL query params. These params currently include _hints_ and _builders_. 

Hints specify which data fields in the user's transactions are shared with searchers on MEV-Share. The following hints are currently available:

<Hints />

Specifying builders permits the specified builders to use your orderflow to build blocks.

:::caution

Adding other builders can make users' transactions land on-chain faster and more reliably, but note that Flashbots does not control how other builders operate and makes no guarantees about their behavior.

:::

The following builders are currently supported. By default, orderflow is only routed to the Flashbots block builder.

#### Set Refund Configuration

By default, the Flashbots MEV-Share Node will send 90% of the searcher's payment to `tx.origin` of the transaction that is backrun. To adjust the refund percentage and recipient(s), append an optional _refund_ URL query param to your request.

The _refund_ param contains two values separated by a colon `:`. The first value is the address that the refund should be transferred to. The second value is the percentage of the searcher's payment that should be refunded. To split the payment across multiple addresses, add a new _refund_ param for each address with the amount that it should receive.

The sum of all percentages specified in _refund_ params must be less than 100. The validator payment is inferred from `100 - sum of refund percentages`. Note that keeping a larger percentage of the refund may result in longer inclusion times, because it reduces the payment to the validator.

#### Examples

Connecting to RPC with this configuration would share logs and function selectors, and send transactions only to Flashbots:

```txt
https://rpc.flashbots.net?hint=logs&hint=function_selector&builder=flashbots
```

Connecting to RPC with this configuration would send 40% of the searcher's payment to "userAddr", 10% to "walletAddr" and the remaining 50% to the validator:

```txt
https://rpc.flashbots.net?refund=userAddr:40&refund=walletAddr:10
```

We recommend experimenting to find the right settings for you and your users. We are happy to partner with your data and product teams to find the best balance.

To learn more about configuring Flashbots Protect, see the [Flashbots Protect RPC docs](/flashbots-protect/mev-share#protect-rpc-reference).

### What are the guarantees and benefits?

The MEV-Share Node will bundle user transactions with each valid searcher backrun and submit them to a dedicated Flashbots builder. The builder will choose the winning bundle and transfer 90% of the searcher's payment to `tx.origin` of the user's transaction.

If no valid backruns are submitted, the transaction will be treated as a regular [Protect transaction](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/quick-start) and receive all the typical benefits of Flashbots Protect.

### What are the risks?

This is a beta release of the Flashbots MEV-Share Node. The MEV-Share Node service may experience service interruptions and there may be API breaks during the trial phase.

By default, the MEV-Share Node shares no transaction information with searchers other than the transaction hash. This is unlikely to result in the largest possible refund. You can customize your request to share additional information and we will closely monitor and update the defaults where needed.

### Next steps

We are exploring a number of improvements. For instance â€” customizable refund percentage & recipients (which would allow wallets or dapps to take a cut), more privacy settings & per-protocol defaults, and more expressive execution preferences (allowing searchers to submit bundles that contain more than simple backruns).

The Flashbots MEV-Share Node is one implementation of the MEV-share protocol. We are also actively designing standard interfaces for the protocol as a whole.
